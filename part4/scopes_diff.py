# variable scope = this is where a variable is visible and accessible
# scope resolution = (LEGB) Local -> Enclosed -> Global -> Built in ... local takes precedence, then enclosed etc...

# variables declared within a function have a local scope... Functions cannot see inside other functions
# enclosed scope is where a function is within another function
#global scope mean that a variable is declared outside any function
# built in scope includes modules
