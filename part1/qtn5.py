"""
   5.	Discuss any five problem-solving methods commonly applied in Python programming,
         highlighting how each method contributes to developing efficient and logical solutions to computational problems.	 
"""

"""
    1. decomposition / breaking the problem down
       by splitting a big problem to smaller manageable tasks it helps reduce complexity

"""


"""
    2. abstraction
      ignoring unnecessary details and focusing on what matters.
      In Python, you do this with functions and classes
      this ensures code reusability
"""

"""
    3. Algorithmic Thinking
        Designing step-by-step instructions to solve a problem
        it helps give clear logic
"""

"""
    4. Pattern Recognition
        Identifying similarities between problems. 
        this helps to have faster solutions and reducing development time
"""

"""
    5. Iterative Testing & Debugging
        Testing the program, finding errors, refining and improving it.
        this helps to improve correctness of the code and improves reliability
